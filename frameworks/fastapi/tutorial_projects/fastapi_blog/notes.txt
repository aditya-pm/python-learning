- Returning raw python strings as HTML strings would be too difficult for large HTML pages
  especially when dynamic data is involved, so we instead template the HTML page (using Jinja)
  and pass in the dynamic data
- we separately maintain API routes and HTML routes, that serve the same data for different 
  audiences
- jinja is installed usually with standard fastapi install, if not use pip install jinja2
- fastapi.templating has Jinja2Templates which is required for template, it this requires fastapi.Request
