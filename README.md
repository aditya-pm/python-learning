# Python Learning Playground

This repository contains my **personal learning notes, experiments, and example code**
while studying Python libraries, frameworks, and core concepts.

The goal of this repository is **learning and reinforcement**, not production-ready software.


## Purpose

- Build a strong mental model of Python libraries and frameworks
- Practice concepts by re-implementing examples from documentation and tutorials
- Maintain a personal reference of small, focused code examples
- Track learning progress over time


## About the Code

- Most examples are **intentionally small and isolated**
- Framework examples may be **multi-file mini-projects**
- Some projects are based on tutorials or courses  
  (these are clearly labeled and credited)
- Code may evolve, be refactored, or be incomplete as part of learning

This repository should be viewed as a **learning notebook**, not a portfolio.


## Repository Structure

- `concepts/`  
  Core Python concepts explored in isolation  
  (e.g. data structures, OOP patterns, concurrency basics)

- `libraries/`  
  Experiments and notes on specific Python libraries  
  (e.g. numpy, pandas, requests, asyncio)

- `frameworks/`  
  Mini-projects and explorations of full frameworks  
  (e.g. Flask, Django, FastAPI)


## Tutorials & Credits

Where applicable, inspiration or structure comes from:
- Official documentation
- Public tutorials (e.g. YouTube, blogs)
- Open-source examples

All tutorial-based projects are:
- Clearly labeled
- Used for educational purposes only
- Extended or modified for personal understanding


## How I Use This Repo

- I add folders as I start learning something new
- I revisit old code to refactor it once my understanding improves
- Some folders represent dead ends — they are kept intentionally


## This Repo Is NOT

- A showcase of polished, production-ready projects
- A replacement for official documentation
- A demonstration of best practices in all cases

For standalone projects, deployments, or polished work,
see separate repositories.


## Notes

- Code is written primarily for **clarity and learning**
- Comments may explain *why* something works, not just *what*
- Breaking things on purpose is part of the process
